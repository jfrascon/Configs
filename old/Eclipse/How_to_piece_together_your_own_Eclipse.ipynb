    "\n",
    "**Eclipse** is developed as a modularized system with a central **core platform** and additional **features** and **plugins** that provide functionality required for a certain language (like Java or C++). These **packaged** versions of Eclipse that are put together for different languages is what is provided on its [download page](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).\n",
    "\n",
    "You may feel that the Eclipse packages available for Java or C++ (CDT) are extremely bloated with hundreds of features and plugins that you may never use. For example, Eclipse CDT includes hundreds of MyLyn features and cross-compiler support, none of which I may require right now. The **beauty** of Eclipse is that everything is a plugin, so you can actually build yourself a lean Eclipse that only includes what you want. This way you can build a minimal Eclipse that has only the features you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Get the platform runtime binary\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The core of Eclipse is provided for download as **Eclipse Platform Runtime Binary**. To get it, go to this [page](http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/) and click on the build number you want. It opens a new page, where you scroll down to the section named **Platform Runtime Binary** and download the package matching your system.\n",
    "2. Unzip the zip file you downloaded and run the `eclipse` binary file. The IDE opens and it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Add the plugins\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Now add the plugins you want from Help -> Install New Software. For plugins provided by Eclipse, choose **Oxygen** from the dropdown. For external plugins, add their URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For creating a Eclipse C++ IDE of my own, I installed these plugins:\n",
    "    * Oxygen -> Programming Languages -> C/C++ Development Tools\n",
    "    * CPPChEclipse\n",
    "3. For creating a Eclipse Python IDE of my own, I installed these plugins:\n",
    "    * PyDev"
